					A plan-driven software process can support incremental development and
					delivery. It is perfectly feasible to allocate requirements and plan the design and
					development phase as a series of increments. An agile process is not inevitably
					code-focused and it may produce some design documentation.
					In fact, most software projects include practices from plan-driven and agile
					approaches. To decide on the balance between a plan-based and an agile
					approach, you have to answer a range of technical, human, and organizational
					questions like Is it important to have a very detailed specification and design
					before moving to implementation? If so, you probably need to use a plan-driven

					rigorous software development processes. This view came from the software
					engineering community that was responsible for developing large, long lived
					software systems such as aerospace and government systems. This software
					was developed by large teams working for different companies. Teams were
					often geographically dispersed and worked on the software for long periods of
					time. An example of this type of software is the control systems for a modern
					aircraft, which might take up to 10 years from initial specification to
					deployment, these plan driven approaches involve a significant overhead in
					planning, designing, and documenting the system. This overhead is justified
					when the work of multiple development teams has to be coordinated, when the
					system is a critical system, and when many different people will be involved in
					maintaining the software over its lifetime.</p>
			<p class="p3">
					As the system requirements change, rework is essential and, in principle at least,
					the specification and design has to change with the program.
					Dissatisfaction with these heavyweight approaches to software engineering led
					a number of software developers in the 1990s to propose new ‘agile methods’.
					These allowed the development team to focus on the software itself rather than
					on its design and documentation. Agile methods universally rely on an
					incremental approach to software specification, development, and delivery.</p>
